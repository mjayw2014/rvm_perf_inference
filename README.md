# Achieve 15-20x performance improvement for vision/perception model inference
The performance (runtime) of any AI model is influenced by its size and precision. AI model developers spend time in optimizing the model size/architecture and precision to achieve better runtime performance. However, there is a limit to reducing model size and precision without losing model quality.
